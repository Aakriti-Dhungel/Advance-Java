## Inheritance in Java

Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another, promoting reusability.

### Single Inheritance

Single inheritance occurs when a class inherits from **one parent class**.

**Example:**
`Calculator` extends `MyMath`.

### Multiple Inheritance (Using Interfaces)

Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from **multiple interfaces**.

**Example:**
`Calculator` implements both `Addition` and `Subtraction`.

### Short Definitions

* **Single Inheritance:** A child class inherits from one parent class.
* **Multiple Inheritance:** A class implements multiple interfaces.
